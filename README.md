## The Library
### Setup

1. git clone https://github.com/YouGuavas/The-Library.git && cd The-Library
2. npm i
3. cd client && npm i
4. npm run build
5. cd .. && npm run dev

### What I learned
- Just because something is working in development, doesn't mean it will work in production. Be thorough.
- Deploying can be just as hard as building if you aren't careful.
- Comments are important.
- It's okay to take breaks and come back to difficult problems later. Just don't give up altogether.
